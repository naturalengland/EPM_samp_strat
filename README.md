# Repository structure
-  main: *only code that does a thing we want it to do*
-  dev: *code that does a thing but maybe not yet what we want it to*
    - fb1_NAME: *A **feature branch**.  Use this for actually writing code that isn't working yet, ideally to resolve a particular issue.  Named sensibly*
    - fb2_NAME: *etc, there will be many of these.  They should be merged into dev and can be closed when issue resolved.*
